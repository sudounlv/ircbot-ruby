# Sudo Semester Project - Ruby

This project is a baseline working version of a IRC bot written in ruby using the cinch plugin.  For the next
phase we will have you adding functionality to this project.


### Requirements
This was written using ruby 1.9.3 - I would strongly suggest using the same version.
